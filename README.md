# BOB - Your AI Dev Buddy

## 🎯 **What is BOB?**

BOB is your intelligent **companion system** that enhances existing AI assistants (like Cline, Kilo Code, or any AI coding tool) by eliminating expensive codebase trawling. For solo developers who work on big projects but hate burning tokens on repetitive context gathering, BOB learns your project, remembers across sessions, and serves up exactly the context your AI assistant needs - when it needs it.

**BOB works alongside your existing AI tools - she's not a replacement, she's an enhancement!**

**Built for:**
- ✅ **Solo Developers** working on complex projects
- ✅ **Sporadic Sessions** - no more "what were we doing?"
- ✅ **Token-Conscious Workflows** - 70%+ reduction in agent costs
- ✅ **Quick Project Hops** - instant understanding of any codebase
- ✅ **Template-Based Projects** - adapts to Next.js, React, Vue, etc.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (2 Minutes)**

### Step 1: Add BOB to Your Project
```bash
# Clone BOB into your project (current method)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bob.git
cp -r bob/* /path/to/your/project/

# Or manually copy the BOB folder contents
# Copy the entire BOB system into your existing project

# Future: npm install -g bob-dev-buddy && bob init
# (Coming soon - CLI tool for easier setup)
```

### Step 2: Tell Your AI Assistant About BOB
```bash
# In Cline, Kilo Code, or your favorite AI assistant:
"Read /docs/BOB_RULES.md to understand our collaboration system, then help me: [your task]"
```

**BOB enhances your existing AI assistant - don't switch tools, just add intelligence!**

### Step 3: See BOB in Action
```bash
# Example conversation with your AI assistant:
You: "Cline, read /docs/BOB_RULES.md and help me add user authentication to my Next.js app"

Cline: Reads BOB → Uses BOB_INJECTION_AUTH → Works efficiently → No expensive trawling
BOB: Learns this pattern → Optimizes for next auth-related task
```

**BOB makes your AI assistant 10x smarter about your project!**

### Step 4: Enjoy Smart Collaboration
- BOB auto-analyzes your project structure
- Builds intelligent context injection points
- Tracks usage to learn what you need most
- Remembers context across sessions
- Alerts you to token costs before they happen
