## ðŸ”§ Key BOB Principles

### Always Use BOB's Intelligence:
- **Injection Points** for efficient context (no trawling)
- **Session Memory** for continuity across work sessions
- **Token Alerts** for cost awareness
- **Learned Patterns** for your specific workflow

### Work Within Limits:
- **Mode protocols** from `/docs/BOB_RULES.md`
- **150-line diff limit** per change
- **3-file maximum** per change
- **Token budgets** and cost transparency

### Never Bypass BOB:
- Use BOB's injection points instead of reading full files
- Respect session continuity for sporadic development
- Pay attention to token alerts to control costs
